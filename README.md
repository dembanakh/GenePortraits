# GenePortraits

A web application for generating frequency portraits (and other types of portraits in the future) of gene sequences, with some customization options.

<div>
  <img title="Home Page" src="/Screenshots/Home.png" alt="Home" width="475"/>
  <img title="Generator Page" src="/Screenshots/Generator.png" alt="Generator" width="475"/>
</div>

Portraits generated by an unlogged user (guest) are available in Repository section with some limitations until their web session expires.
On the other hand, portraits generated by registered users are stored persistently.

<div>
  <img title="Result Portrait" src="/Screenshots/Portrait.png" alt="Portrait" width="475"/>
  <img title="Repository Page" src="/Screenshots/Repository.png" alt="Repository" width="475"/>
</div>


# Technical Details

This is a **Django** application, hosted on **Heroku** platform.
- **Django-auth** is responsible for authorizing users.
- **SQLite** is exploited to store portraits persistently.
- A portrait is a frequency portrait of short subsequences of a gene sequence, which is fetched from [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database based on a short gene term using python **requests** library.

# How To Use

Visit https://gene-portraits.herokuapp.com/home. Since, for now, the app is hosted on Heroku, the first page loading may take a while.

In Generator, currently only TERM load method is supported, in which case Gene field expects a gene term in NCBI format (locus, optionally appended with ':c' and index range).

# How To Build

Python v3.8 recommended.

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python manage.py migrate`
3. `python manage.py runserver` to start up a localhost development server
4. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
